## TODO

### Algorithm

- OK: find functions
- OK: mark functions in a unique way across the program (using parent and signature)
- TODO: when doing the diff, search for the closest-matching function in the database

### Bonus features if we have the time

- change log factory?
- run the function directly in the editor if click on a play button (by importing the module + running the func)
- for instance, in the little tooltip
